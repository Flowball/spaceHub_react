# SPEJS

### React.js school submission

<br>

This project uses React JS along with features like hooks, router, props, and API fetching.
The main aim is to practice these skills.
Styling is done using the [stylex](https://stylexjs.com/) library.
<br>
As it's in the early stages, the project requires downloading a BETA package to run properly with VITE (included in package.json).

Install the project by cloning to desired folder. <br>

```js
npm install
```

or

```js
bun install
```
